# Authoring a CCTC Extension

A Claude Code Terminal Center (CCTC) extension is a self-contained feature — a
nav entry plus a panel, optionally backed by main-process capabilities — that
plugs into the app shell without editing core. Extensions build against the
stable `@cctc/extension-sdk` contract and load at runtime from disk.

Fastest start: scaffold with [`tools/create-cctc-extension`](../tools/create-cctc-extension),
or copy the worked sample at [`examples/extensions/hello`](../examples/extensions/hello).

## On-disk shape

The host discovers extensions under `~/.cc-center/extensions/<id>/`:

```
~/.cc-center/extensions/hello/
  extension.json        manifest
  renderer.js           the panel bundle (ESM, default-exports a RendererEntry)
  main.js               optional main module (ESM, default-exports a MainModule)
```

## Manifest (`extension.json`)

```json
{
  "id": "hello",
  "title": "Hello",
  "icon": "Sparkles",
  "entry": { "renderer": "renderer.js", "main": "main.js" },
  "engines": { "cctcApi": "^1.0.0" },
  "permissions": ["projects:read"]
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Stable, URL-safe id. Doubles as the nav id and the storage namespace. Must match `MainModule.id`. |
| `title` | Sidebar label. |
| `icon` | A **lucide-react icon name** (e.g. `Sparkles`, `Ticket`), resolved host-side. Unknown names fall back to `HelpCircle`. |
| `titleLabel` | Optional window-title suffix when active; defaults to `title`. |
| `entry.renderer` | Filename of the renderer bundle, relative to the extension dir. Optional (a headless extension omits it). |
| `entry.main` | Filename of the main bundle. Optional (a renderer-only extension omits it). |
| `engines.cctcApi` | Contract-version range; the host gates against `SDK_API_VERSION` at load and refuses to mount on mismatch. |
| `permissions` | Capabilities the extension intends to use. **Declared, not enforced today** — see below. |

## The renderer entry — why React is injected

The renderer bundle default-exports a `RendererEntry`: an `activate({ React, host })`
factory that returns the panel component.

```ts
import type { RendererEntry } from '@cctc/extension-sdk/renderer';

const entry: RendererEntry = {
  activate({ React, host }) {
    return function Panel() {
      const [n, setN] = React.useState(0);
      return React.createElement('button', { onClick: () => setN(n + 1) }, `${host.moduleId}: ${n}`);
    };
  },
};
export default entry;
```

The host blob-imports the bundle and calls `entry.activate({ React, host })`,
passing **its own React instance**. The bundle must NOT `import 'react'`: a
second React copy in one tree breaks hooks ("Invalid hook call" / mismatched
dispatcher), because hook state lives in module-level singletons. Building with
`React.createElement` (rather than JSX) keeps the bundle from referencing the
externalized jsx-runtime. The returned component is mounted with a `{ host }`
prop.

`host` (`ModuleHost`) is the only surface an extension touches — there is no
escape hatch to `window.cc`. It exposes: `moduleId`, `call`, `storage`,
`openExternal`, `pushInbox`, `toast`, `getActiveProject`, `listProjects`,
`selectProject`, `launchSession`.

## The main module (optional)

`main.js` default-exports a `MainModule`. `setup(ctx)` runs once at boot and
returns a map of named capabilities; the panel reaches each via
`host.call('<name>', ...args)`. Capabilities run in the main process with Node
access; return values are structured-cloned over IPC, so they must be
JSON-serialisable. Add `teardown()` to release timers/watchers/child processes
on disable.

```ts
import { defineMainModule } from '@cctc/extension-sdk';
export default defineMainModule({
  id: 'hello',
  setup(ctx) {
    return { async ping(name: string) { ctx.log(`ping ${name}`); return { ok: true }; } };
  },
});
```

## Build (externals)

Use Vite **library mode** — one entry in, one ESM out — and externalize what the
host owns:

- **Renderer build:** externalize `react`, `react-dom`, `react/jsx-runtime`,
  `lucide-react`. The host provides React (via `activate`) and the icon library.
- **Main build:** externalize `electron` and Node built-ins; bundle everything
  else the extension imports (the host's `node_modules` is asar-locked and not
  available to an on-disk extension).

Output filenames must match the manifest `entry`. The scaffold's
[`vite.config.ts`](../tools/create-cctc-extension/template/vite.config.ts) does
both builds (selected by a `BUILD_TARGET` env var).

## Install & dev loop

```sh
npm run build
ID=hello
mkdir -p ~/.cc-center/extensions/$ID
cp extension.json dist/renderer.js ~/.cc-center/extensions/$ID/
cp dist/main.js ~/.cc-center/extensions/$ID/   # only if you ship a main module
```

Dev loop: edit `src/` → `npm run build` → re-copy into the extensions dir →
re-enable in CCTC.

## Enable / disable — the relaunch caveat

Extensions are enabled/disabled in CCTC (Settings → Extensions) via an
enabled-map (modeled on the CLI-plugins loader). **Toggling enable triggers a
relaunch** so the main-side module is `import()`-ed fresh and the renderer
re-blob-imports the new bundle — main-process module caching means a live
hot-swap isn't done in this phase. Plan your dev loop around a relaunch after
each rebuild.

## Permissions are declared, not enforced (today)

The `permissions` field ships now but nothing checks it yet — this is the
**curated-trust** phase: extensions are as trusted as the built-in modules.
Declare what you intend to use anyway; enforcement (a capability broker at the
dispatch boundary, isolation, consent) lands in a later phase, and declaring now
makes opening up additive rather than a breaking retrofit.
