/**
 * The shape a **runtime-loaded** panel bundle must `default`-export. This is the
 * disk-loading counterpart to `AppModule.panel`: where a built-in module hands
 * core a ready React `ComponentType`, a runtime-loaded extension instead exports
 * a factory that core calls to *build* that component.
 *
 * **Why a factory instead of exporting the component directly?**
 * A runtime-loaded panel is a separately-built ESM bundle. If it did
 * `import 'react'` of its own, the bundler would either inline a *second* copy
 * of React or rely on a fragile import-map to dedupe against the host's copy.
 * Two React instances in one tree break hooks ("Invalid hook call" / mismatched
 * dispatcher) because hook state lives in module-level singletons. To avoid
 * that, the host passes **its own React instance** into `activate`; the panel
 * builds its component closed over that instance, so every hook the panel runs
 * resolves against the host's React tree. The extension's bundle externalizes
 * `react` entirely and never ships or imports one.
 *
 * `activate` is called once per mount by the host loader; the returned component
 * receives the same `{ host }` prop contract as `AppModule.panel`, so a panel's
 * body is identical whether it's built-in or runtime-loaded.
 *
 * Built-in modules keep using `AppModule.panel` unchanged — this factory is the
 * *runtime* code path, not a replacement for it.
 *
 * **Contributing commands / navBadge from a runtime bundle.** `activate` may
 * return EITHER the panel component directly (the original, still-supported
 * shape) OR an {@link ActivateResult} carrying `panel` alongside `commands`
 * and/or `navBadge`. Those two use the **same `(host) => …` signatures** as
 * {@link AppModule.commands} / {@link AppModule.navBadge}, so the host loader
 * forwards them onto the built `AppModule` with no adaptation — a disk-installed
 * extension now reaches the command palette and the sidebar badge slot exactly
 * like a built-in. A bare component return is normalized to `{ panel }`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // extension's renderer entry, built as ESM with `react` externalized
 * import type { RendererEntry } from '@cctc/extension-sdk/renderer';
 *
 * const entry: RendererEntry = {
 *   activate({ React, host }) {
 *     return function Panel() {
 *       const [n, setN] = React.useState(0); // host's React → hooks work
 *       return React.createElement('button', { onClick: () => setN(n + 1) }, `${host.moduleId}: ${n}`);
 *     };
 *   },
 * };
 * export default entry;
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // richer return: panel + a palette command + a nav badge
 * const entry: RendererEntry = {
 *   activate({ React, host }) {
 *     const Panel = () => React.createElement('div', null, host.moduleId);
 *     return {
 *       panel: Panel,
 *       commands: (h) => [{ id: 'ping', label: 'Hello: ping', run: () => h.toast('pong') }],
 *       navBadge: (h) => h.listProjects().length,
 *     };
 *   },
